# espruino-lis3dh

The goal of this project is to play with an Adafruit LIS3DH accelerometer plugged to an ESP8266 breakout board. The ESP is an Adafruit Huzzah flashed with Espruino.
All the communication are using the I2C protocol.

I'm following the [tutorial from Adafruit.](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-lis3dh-triple-axis-accelerometer-breakout)
